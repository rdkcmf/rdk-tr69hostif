 * The role of the protocol handler is to identify and classify flows based on application awareness.
 * - For example, a SIP protocol handler might identify a call-control flow, an audio flow, and a
 * video flow. The App and Flow tables are used to specify the classification outcome associated
 * with each such flow.
 *
 * For each App table entry there can be one or more associated Flow table entries. Each flow table
 * entry identifies a type of flow associated with the protocol handler. The Type parameter is used
 * to identify the specific type of flow associated with each entry.
 * - For example, a Flow table entry for a SIP protocol handler might refer only to the audio
 * flows associated with that protocol handler.
 *
 * A protocol handler can be defined as being fed from the output of a Classification table entry.
 * That is, a Classification entry can be used to single out control traffic to be passed to the protocol
 * handler, which then subsequently identifies associated flows. Doing so allows more than one
 * instance of a protocol handler associated with distinct traffic.
 * - For example, one could define two App table entries associated with SIP protocol handlers.
 * If the classifier distinguished control traffic to feed into each handler based on the destination
 * IP address of the SIP server, this could be used to separately classify traffic for different
 * SIP service providers. In this case, each instance of the protocol handler would identify only
 * those flows associated with a given service.
 *
 * @note Note that the Classification table entry that feeds each protocol handler wouldnt encompass all
 * of the flows, only the traffic needed by the protocol handler to determine the flowsÂ—typically
 * only the control traffic.
