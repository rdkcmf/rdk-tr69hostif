/**
 * @defgroup TR69_HOSTIF_WIFI TR-069 Object (Device.WiFi)
 * The WiFi object is based on the WiFi Alliance 802.11 specifications ([802.11-2007]).
 * It defines interface objects (Radio and SSID), and application objects (AccessPoint and EndPoint).
 *
 * @par About TR-069 Object Device.WiFi.AccessPoint.{i}
 * @n
 * This object models an 802.11 connection from the perspective of a wireless access point.
 * Each AccessPoint entry is associated with a particular SSID interface instance via the SSIDReference parameter.
 * @n @n
 * For enabled table entries, if SSIDReference is not a valid reference then the table entry is inoperable
 * and the CPE MUST set Status to Error_Misconfigured.
 * @n
 * @note The AccessPoint table includes a unique key parameter that is a strong reference.
 * If a strongly referenced object is deleted, the CPE will set the referencing parameter to an empty string.
 * However, doing so under these circumstances might cause the updated AccessPoint row to then violate
 * the table's unique key constraint; if this occurs, the CPE MUST set Status to Error_Misconfigured
 * and disable the offending AccessPoint row.
 * @n @n
 * At most one entry in this table (regardless of whether or not it is enabled) can exist with a given value
 * for Alias. On creation of a new table entry, the CPE MUST choose an initial value for Alias such that the
 * new entry does not conflict with any existing entries.
 * @n @n
 * At most one enabled entry in this table can exist with a given value for SSIDReference.
 *
 * @par About TR-069 Object Device.WiFi.EndPoint.{i}
 * @n
 * This object models an 802.11 connection from the perspective of a wireless end point.
 * Each EndPoint entry is associated with a particular SSID interface instance via the SSIDReference parameter,
 * and an associated active Profile instance via the ProfileReference parameter.
 * The active profile is responsible for specifying the actual SSID and security settings used by the end point.
 * @n @n
 * For enabled table entries, if SSIDReference or ProfileReference is not a valid reference then the table entry
 * is inoperable and the CPE MUST set Status to Error_Misconfigured.
 * @n @n
 * Note: The EndPoint table includes a unique key parameter that is a strong reference.
 * If a strongly referenced object is deleted, the CPE will set the referencing parameter to an empty string.
 * However, doing so under these circumstances might cause the updated EndPoint row to then violate the table's
 * unique key constraint;
 * @n @n
 * if this occurs, the CPE MUST set Status to Error_Misconfigured and disable the offending EndPoint row.
 * At most one entry in this table (regardless of whether or not it is enabled) can exist with a given value for Alias.
 * On creation of a new table entry, the CPE MUST choose an initial value for Alias
 * such that the new entry does not conflict with any existing entries.
 * @n @n
 * At most one enabled entry in this table can exist with a given value for SSIDReference.
 *
 * @par About TR-069 Object Device.WiFi.Radio.{i}.
 * @n
 * This object models an 802.11 wireless radio on a device (a stackable interface object as described
 * in [Section 4.2/TR-181i2]).
 * @n @n
 * If the device can establish more than one connection simultaneously (e.g. a dual radio device),
 * a separate Radio instance MUST be used for each physical radio of the device. See [Appendix III.1/TR-181i2]
 * for additional information.
 * @n
 * @note A dual-band single-radio device (e.g. an 802.11a/b/g radio) can be configured to operate at 2.4 or
 * 5 GHz frequency bands, but only a single frequency band is used to transmit/receive at a given time.
 * Therefore, a single Radio instance is used even for a dual-band radio.
 * @n @n
 * At most one entry in this table can exist with a given value for Alias, or with a given value for Name.
 *
 * @par About TR-069 Object Device.WiFi.SSID.{i}.
 * @n
 * WiFi SSID table (a stackable interface object as described in [Section 4.2/TR-181i2]), where table
 * entries model the MAC layer. A WiFi SSID entry is typically stacked on top of a Radio object.
 * @n
 * WiFi SSID is also a multiplexing layer, i.e. more than one SSID can be stacked above a single Radio.
 * @n
 * At most one entry in this table (regardless of whether or not it is enabled) can exist with a given
 * value for Alias, or with a given value for Name. On creation of a new table entry, the CPE MUST choose
 * initial values for Alias and Name such that the new entry does not conflict with any existing entries.
 * @n
 * At most one enabled entry in this table can exist with a given value for SSID, or with a given value for BSSID.
